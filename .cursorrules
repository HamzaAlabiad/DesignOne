# Mechatronics Sorting & Assembly Project

## Project Overview
This is a 3-subsystem mechatronics project:
1. Feeding subsystem (pneumatic cylinder controlled by relay)
2. Sorting subsystem (laser + IR sensors for classification)
3. 3-DOF Cartesian robot with vacuum gripper

## Hardware
- 2x ESP32 (dual-core)
- 2-channel relay module (pneumatic control)
- IR sensors (object detection + color classification)
- Laser sensor (height classification)
- 3x stepper motors (X, Y, Z axes)
- 3x quadrature encoders
- Vacuum pump (suction gripper)

## Code Standards
- Use FreeRTOS for all tasks
- Core 0: ESP-NOW communication only
- Core 1: All other tasks
- Use Hungarian notation for pins (e.g., PIN_IR_POS1)
- All sensor readings must be filtered (moving average)
- Motor control uses cascaded PI-P controller (Week 10 lab)
- ESP-NOW protocol for inter-ESP32 communication (Week 13 lab)

## Development Phases
Currently on: Phase X (update this as you progress)

## Important Notes
- Pneumatic cylinder needs 500ms to extend/retract
- Encoder resolution: X pulses/mm (fill in after calibration)
- Vacuum needs 300ms to establish suction
